# Stop-Watch
Welcome to the Stopwatch Project! We will create a timer displayed at the top, along with three buttons - start, stop, and reset. Clicking the START button will begin the timer. The STOP button will pause the timer using a JavaScript method called SetInterval, which can be cleared using clearInterval. The RESET button will reset the timer to zero.
